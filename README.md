# WorkAround: A CS-262 Team-H Project </h1>

## Vision Statement 
  Students hate Workday. Workday’s user interface has time-consuming, unintuitive directories hiding students’ class schedules. Even after successfully navigating, the schedule displayed is an unclear, messy window which students find frustrating. Moreover, Workday’s app has a different UI for Android and iOS devices: both of which are incoherent and difficult to navigate. Currently, the alternative is for students to maintain their own schedule on a generic calendar app. This is a time-consuming and unrealistic option for many Calvin students. 

  To assist the Calvin community, WorkAround will provide a straightforward and accessible way to view one’s class schedule. Our app, WorkAround, will be an effective, easy-to-use alternative to Workday’s cumbersome user interface, especially regarding the viewing of class schedules. With a single sign-on and simple setup, users receive a tool to view their schedules quickly all semester. WorkAround centers around one page: the schedule. Tasks like editing and adding an event can be done with an easy and intuitive Edit Screen. The personalization options provided in WorkAround also relieve students from having to use generic, dull calendar apps to maintain their schedules. Hoping to be useful to both students and professors, WorkAround will incorporate features such as easy access to Student Services, a delightful UI, a simple way to share schedules with peers, and a notification system to notify users of upcoming classes. WorkAround will provide what Workday could not: a quick, light, intuitive user experience.
