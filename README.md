Our app, WorkAround, would be an effective and easy-to-use alternative to Workday’s cumbersome User Interface, specifically regarding viewing the current class schedule. Workday’s current user interface has unintuitive directories and time-consuming procedures to access the user’s class schedule. Even after successfully navigating, the schedule is displayed in an unclear, messy viewing window, which users find frustrating. To combat this frustration and assist the Calvin community, WorkAround will provide a straightforward and accessible way to view one’s class schedule. Hoping to be useful to both students and professors, WorkAround will incorporate important features such as: an easy access to Student Services, a delightful UI- that would encompass a campus guide to all their buildings- and a simple way to share schedules with peers.
